# VoiceYourMail
The main aim of the project is reading emails and converting the received emails to
voice using Raspberry Pi.
Raspberry pi is a credit card sized single board computer developed by the Raspberry
Pi Foundation in the UK with the intention of promoting the teaching of basic computer
science in the schools.
 The Raspberry Pi 3 is equipped with a quad-core 64-bit Broadcom BCM2837 ARM
Cortex-A53 SoC Processor running at 1.2GHz, it is having 400MHz VideoCore IV
multimedia. Raspberry Pi was shipped originally with 1GB RAM. It does not have a build in
hard disk or any other kind of drive, so it uses an External SD card for booting and persistent
storage.
 The system has Secure Digital (SD) (models A and B) or Micro SD (Models A+ and
B+) sockets for boot media and persistent storage.
 In 2014, the Raspberry Pi Foundation launched the compute Module, which packages
a BCM2837 with 1GB RAM and an eMMC flash chip into a module for use as a part of
embedded systems. The Foundation provides Debian and Arch Linux ARM Distributions for
download.
 The architecture of Raspberry Pi and is understood including the ports and GPIO pins.
The pin descriptions and architecture of ARM11 and ATmega328 are understood. The
Raspberry Pi board is initialized using IP address of the board. The raspberry Pi is activated
using a login Id and Password. The python codes is written and executed in Raspberry Pi. 
As a part of our curriculum this project we made using raspberry pi using python
programming language. We have seen many people who have disabilities and not much
educated.
EXSISTING SYSTEM:
To know the information of the emails in those days people should go through the netcenter
or open there account and they need to check there mails every time.
PROPOSED SYSTEM:
In this we are proposed that, reading emails received using text to voice converter by
using Raspberry pi. When mail is received instantly that will convert in to text to voice so that
we can here the mails which we received. We can also implement in real time also. The
Raspberry Pi is a credit card-sized single-board computer developed in the UK by the
Raspberry Pi Foundation with the intention of promoting the teaching of basic computer
science in schools.
