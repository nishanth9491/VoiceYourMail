# VoiceYourMail


The **VoiceYourMail** project aims to read emails and convert received emails into voice using Raspberry Pi. This initiative utilizes the capabilities of the Raspberry Pi, a credit card-sized single-board computer developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in the UK, with the primary goal of promoting basic computer science education.

## Raspberry Pi Specifications

- **Processor:** Quad-core 64-bit Broadcom BCM2837 ARM Cortex-A53 SoC Processor (1.2GHz)
- **Multimedia:** 400MHz VideoCore IV
- **RAM:** 1GB (originally shipped)
- **Storage:** External SD card for booting and persistent storage
- **Boot Media:** Secure Digital (SD) (models A and B) or Micro SD (Models A+ and B+)
- **Compute Module (2014):** BCM2837 with 1GB RAM and an eMMC flash chip for embedded systems
- **Operating Systems:** Debian and Arch Linux ARM Distributions

## System Initialization

The Raspberry Pi board is initialized using the IP address, requiring a login ID and password for activation. Python code is written and executed on the Raspberry Pi as part of the project implementation.

## Existing System

In the existing system, users need to manually check their emails by accessing net centers or opening their email accounts, which can be inconvenient and time-consuming.

## Proposed System

The proposed system involves reading emails using a text-to-voice converter on Raspberry Pi. Upon receiving an email, it instantly converts into text-to-voice, allowing users to hear their emails. Real-time implementation is also considered for added convenience.
